# Clean Architecture
Date: 28-12-2024

Description: Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that separates the application into layers, each responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality. The layers are:

- Presentation layer: responsible for user interface and input/output operations
- Domain layer: responsible for business logic and domain-specific entities
- Infrastructure layer: responsible for data access and persistence
- Application layer: responsible for business logic and domain-specific entities

The goal of Clean Architecture is to make the application more maintainable, testable, and reusable by separating the application into layers that are easy to understand and modify.

## Why Clean Architecture?
- It makes the application more maintainable by separating the application into layers that are easy to understand and modify
- It makes the application more testable by separating the application into layers that are easy to test
- It makes the application more reusable by separating the application into layers that are easy to reuse

## How to Implement Clean Architecture?
- Separate the application into layers
- Implement the layers using the principles of Clean Architecture

## Benefits of Clean Architecture
- It makes the application more maintainable
- It makes the application more testable
- It makes the application more reusable
- It makes the application more scalable

## Drawbacks of Clean Architecture
- It makes the application more complex
- It makes the application more difficult to understand
- It makes the application more difficult to maintain
- It makes the application more difficult to test
- It makes the application more difficult to reuse
- It makes the application more difficult to scale
