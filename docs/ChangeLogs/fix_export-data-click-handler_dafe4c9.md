**Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Commit:** dafe4c9  
**Type:** fix  
**Components:** Multiple files  

## Description

Fixed a TypeScript error in the ExportData component and made significant UI improvements across multiple components. The changes include fixing the click handler implementation, enhancing user feedback messages, and improving the overall user interface design.

## Changes

### 1. ExportData Component
- Fixed TypeScript error where `link.click()` was incorrectly called with callbacks
- Updated success message to be more accurate ("Data prepared" instead of "Data exported")
- Added automatic cleanup of success message after 5 seconds

**Before:**
```typescript
link.click(
    () => {
        setSuccessMessage(`Data exported successfully as ${filename}`);
    },
    (err: { message: React.SetStateAction<string>; }) => {
        setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred while exporting data');
    }
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
link.click();
setSuccessMessage(`Data prepared successfully as ${filename}`);
```

### 2. User Interface Improvements
- Added ring color utilities in theme-variables.css for better visual feedback
- Enhanced form styling with transitions and better visual hierarchy
